 # How To Run
 1. First you must have python 
 Linux (Ubuntu/debian based) example: `sudo apt install python-is-python3`

 2. You must change 'n' 'n1' 'n2' 'il' in the `NICENTOSH.py` File. To look like this.

`n = 1`
`n1 = 0`
`n2 = 0`
`il = 0`

2.1. (OPTIONAL) You can also change some of the settings.

3. Last one is running. In the terminal type `python ROOT.py` or `python3 ROOT.py` Make sure that you are in the same directory as the files.
